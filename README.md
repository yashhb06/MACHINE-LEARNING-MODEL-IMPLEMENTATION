# 📧 Spam Email Detection using Scikit-Learn

A simple and effective machine learning model built with Scikit-learn to detect spam messages using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The model uses the Naive Bayes algorithm and classifies messages as **Spam** or **Not Spam** based on training data.

## 🚀 Features
* Clean and beginner-friendly code using Python and Scikit-learn
* Text preprocessing with `CountVectorizer` (Bag-of-Words)
* Trained using `MultinomialNB` (Naive Bayes Classifier)
* Evaluation with accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix
* Sample prediction to test custom messages
* Jupyter Notebook for step-by-step exploration

## 🧠 Dataset
The dataset contains labeled messages as either **"ham"** (not spam) or **"spam"**.
Each row has:
* `label`: `'ham'` or `'spam'`
* `message`: the content of the SMS/email

> You can replace the dataset with a larger one from [Kaggle - SMS Spam Collection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset) for better performance.

## 🔧 How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gandhidev2005/MACHINE-LEARNING-MODEL-IMPLEMENTATION.git
   ```
2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
   ```
3. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook main.ipynb
   ```
4. Run the cells and explore the model 🚀

## 🖼 Sample Output
* Accuracy: \~100% on sample data
* Sample prediction:
  ```python
  "You have won $1000 cash!" → Spam
  "Hey, are we still on for tomorrow?" → Not Spam
  ```
  
## 📌 Future Improvements
* Use advanced NLP techniques like TF-IDF or Word Embeddings
* Integrate deep learning models (LSTM, BERT)
* Deploy the model via Flask or Streamlit as a web app
